### Added

- Added `slot="badge"` to `mui-button` for positioning notification badges (`mui-badge`) at the top-right corner of standard and icon-only buttons.
- `mui-button` automatically tracks `has-badge` destination attribute when content is slotted into `slot="badge"`.
- `mui-button` automatically scales slotted notification badges relative to button size (`xx-small`, `x-small`, `small`, `medium`, `large`).
- Added `width` attribute to `mui-button` (defaults to `auto`, accepts custom metric values such as `100%`, `200px`, `16rem`).
- Added `shape="circle"` attribute to `mui-button` for rendering fully circular icon-only action buttons (`aspect-ratio: 1 / 1`).
- Added `gap` attribute to `mui-button` for overriding internal slot spacing between `before`, `label`, and `after` slots (e.g. `gap="var(--space-200)"`).
- Added standalone `mui-header-bar` (`HeaderBar`) component for top application shell and workspace headers with automatic drawer column alignment (`left-width`, `right-width`), height token binding (`size="x-small | small | medium | large"`), surface variants (`default | transparent`), and bottom border toggle (`bottom-border`).
- Added optional keyboard-accessible `resize-rail` controls to `mui-header-bar`, including minimum column/main widths, shared Drawer rail tokens, and resize start/update/end events for synchronized shell layouts.
- Added dedicated Storybook story page for `mui-header-bar` featuring responsive 2-column and 3-column headers, custom right sections, height size scales, responsive container-query alternatives, Push Drawer Shell, and synchronized Push Rail Drawer Shell examples.

### Fixed & Improved

- Updated `:host([height])` and `:host([width])` selectors in `mui-v-stack`, `mui-h-stack`, and `mui-grid` to exclude `auto` (`:not([height="auto"])`, `:not([width="auto"])`), preventing intrinsic shrink-wrapping from breaking when explicit `auto` is set.
- Fixed `shape="circle"` CSS specificity so circular border-radius and padding win over size-variant rules.
- Updated size-specific gap CSS rules (`xx-small`, `x-small`, `small`, `large`) in `mui-button` to fallback to `var(--button-gap, ...)` so `gap="..."` works dynamically across all button sizes.
- Updated `MuiTube` composition header toolbar buttons with `shape="circle"` and sidebar navigation actions with `align="start"` and custom slot gaps (`gap="var(--space-200)"` and `gap="var(--space-300)"`).
- Removed `default-open` condition from Component navigation accordion sections in navbar for improved tab navigation order.
- `mui-badge` now enforces equal `min-width` and `min-height` with flex centering and text alignment (`box-sizing: border-box`, `justify-content: center`, `text-align: center`), ensuring single-digit count indicators render as crisp, centered circles.
- Button story page now includes a dedicated **Notification Badges** story card demonstrating variant selection guidelines and scale auto-sizing across action types.
- Avatar Chip Dropdown examples now include x-small through large profile actions with trailing chevrons.
- Buttons containing an Avatar Chip and trailing down-chevron now apply size-aware logical edge spacing, with more space at x-small and small; the chevron inherits its size from Button.
- Avatar-only Buttons now use the Button `size` as the source of truth and resize their Avatar to the matching action footprint; the Button story demonstrates x-small through large options.
- Header Bar now applies the explicit `usage="header-bar"` composition context: unsized Dropdowns inherit Header Bar size, pass it to their trigger and Menu, and profile Buttons pass matching density to Avatar Chip or Avatar content while chevrons inherit action size.
- Standard non-circular Header Bar Buttons fill the bar height with square edges; circular and Avatar-only actions retain their normal action-size footprint. Header Bar Avatar and Avatar Chip content maps its avatar footprint to the matching action-size token (for example medium uses `4.4rem` rather than the standalone medium Avatar’s `4.8rem`).
- Header Bar now reapplies Dropdown and Button composition context after their custom-element definitions are upgraded, ensuring full-height profile actions and action-sized avatars activate reliably regardless of component registration order.
- Header Bar notification actions now demonstrate attention badges through the Button `badge` slot.
- Header Bar stories now use medium Search Inputs and secondary circular notification actions consistently.
- Standard Header Bar action groups now use `var(--space-500)` between the notification action and profile Dropdown.
- Full-height profile Dropdown examples now meet the Header Bar’s right edge: main-region compositions retain only their left inset, while the terminal right-slot wrapper uses no padding.
- Header Bar’s **Size Scale** story now pairs matching Search Inputs and inherited secondary notification actions with separate x-small through large comparisons for Avatar Chip and Avatar-only profile Dropdown actions.
- Header Bar’s **Size Scale** Responsive wrappers now observe their own available story width and use complete compact Header Bar alternatives instead of placeholder text-only fallback bars.
- In the Header Bar **Size Scale**, the x-small bar now composes small Search Input, notification Button/icon, and profile Dropdown controls for a more usable compact action density.
- Circular Buttons now use a tighter base notification badge placement, with `x-small` Buttons tuned to `translate(40%, -40%)` and `small` Buttons to `translate(32%, -32%)`; the full comparison is demonstrated in the **Notification Badges** story.
- Header Bar shell stories now demonstrate complete responsive alternatives, container-aware main actions, Drawer toggle synchronization, left-slot reassignment when navigation closes, and immediate bidirectional width updates between Header Bar and Drawer.
- Added a non-prescriptive Header Bar composition-density knowledge fragment covering compact, standard, and spacious sizing options for search, circular actions, notification badges, profile Dropdowns, Avatar Chips, and responsive alternatives.
- Retired the legacy hand-built Grid header from Drawer shell knowledge. Global app shells now compose `HeaderBar` and Drawer as siblings, synchronize Drawer width through `HeaderBar.left-width`, and defer header sizing, borders, surfaces, profile actions, and responsive choices to Header Bar behavior and its composition-density guide.
- Added a canonical Avatar Chip Profile Actions knowledge fragment covering valid Dropdown anatomy, standalone and Header Bar emphasis, inherited sizing, chevron behavior, Avatar-only alternatives, and complete JSON composition. Header Bar and Avatar Chip story code examples were audited against their rendered examples.
- Fixed `mui-field` success and error message icons by mapping its public validation variants to the renamed Body semantic treatments (`positive` and `attention`).
- Added Header Bar destination metadata for the runtime `has-left` and `has-right` attributes so generated dynamic-attribute knowledge matches its slotted column behavior.
- Added an Icons story showing every icon inside circular secondary Buttons across the full Button size scale, with left, right, up, and down chevrons listed first.
- Reduced the shared `xx-small` icon footprint from `1.3rem` to `1.2rem` across standalone icons, Icon Toggle, and the shared icon helper.
- Updated Chip Rail overflow actions to use circular Buttons while continuing to inherit the rail size and automatic icon sizing.

### Added

- `mui-card` now supports `size="none | small | medium | large"` and propagates that spacing density to direct Card Header, Body, and Footer sections.
- Card Header and Card Footer now expose the same size scale as Card Body, while Button Group footers continue to remove their top padding.
- `mui-card usage="grid | h-stack"` now gives Card Body the flexible row in equal-height Grid and H Stack compositions while preserving direct-child order and auto-sized elements such as `mui-rule`.
- `mui-table` now supports `size="xx-small | x-small | small | medium | large"` and propagates it to owned heading and body rows.
- Accordion Block now supports `xx-small` and `x-small` alongside its existing sizes, with size-aware heading typography, disclosure icons, and detail spacing while retaining medium as the default baseline and keeping heading level semantic.
- `mui-slat` now supports `x-small | small | medium | large`; Action Slats pass their size to the internal Button so action height and typography follow the same scale.
- `mui-market-sparkline` now supports `scale="both | time | price | none"`, keeping its bottom time scale and right-side value scale hidden by default while allowing either or both to be shown when needed.
- Added shared, composable chart-header guidance for Market Sparkline, Financial Bar Chart, and Comparison Chart JSON trees, including named-slot placement and adaptable Muibook header compositions.

### Improved

- Tables, Accordions, and Slats composed in Card Body now use Card-size-aware insets. Edge-to-edge `size="none"` Slats retain their internal row inset without applying a negative Slat Group offset.
- Card, Accordion, Table, and Slat stories now include size comparisons for reviewing density and Card offsets.
- Market Sparkline stories now compare all four scale treatments, and the chart API guidance consistently identifies the bottom time scale and right-side value scale.
- Structured chart-data knowledge now documents exact JSON contracts, finite numeric values, chronological and unique times, valid OHLC relationships, Financial Bar Chart units and signed values, and raw-series requirements for Comparison Chart modes.
- Generated Muibook and Redactd Canvas knowledge now treats chart headers as adaptable compositions rather than fixed anatomy and includes the shared chart data and header rules in the relevant build outputs.

### Fixed

- Rich-content Dropdown stories and the internal Date and Time Picker menus now declare explicit viewport-safe widths so Calendar, Timeslot, Smart Card, and upload content remain inside the Menu surface.
- The internal Time Picker Menu now clips its scrolling wheel content to the rounded surface boundary.
- Badge documentation, JSON rules, and generated skills now use only the supported `neutral | positive | warning | attention | overlay` variants and explicitly reject `secondary`, `default`, and `error`; unsupported runtime values safely fall back to neutral.
- `mui-avatar-chip` now supports `background` and `background-color`, forwarding named treatments or custom CSS colors to its internal avatar and documenting both options in a dedicated story.

### Fixed

- `mui-drawer` now clears stale host-level `inert` when switching out of overlay mode, preventing workspace drawers from becoming unselectable in React-driven editors.
- `mui-drawer` workspace panels now keep open left and right regions interactive in bounded or narrow canvases, including Redactd Canvas compositions.
- `mui-drawer` now supports `hide-header` to explicitly suppress built-in header chrome, and no longer renders the legacy spacer used for old header height preservation.
- `mui-dialog` now supports `hide-header` for consistent built-in header suppression, and its title and actions slots now use stronger assigned-node content detection.
- `mui-submenu` now closes its portalled nested menu when tapping outside it, fixing mobile dismissal after opening a submenu trigger.
- `mui-carousel-controller` now uses more forgiving touch and pen swipe detection, improving mobile panel swiping while preserving vertical page scroll.
- Muibook generation guidance now preserves default `mui-slat` columns unless custom tracks are clearly required, and prefers push drawers for single menu-triggered side panels instead of workspace drawers.

### Breaking

- Submenu now owns its tertiary, start-aligned Button trigger and fixed size-mapped chevron, preserves size-specific trailing chevron spacing inside non-inset Menus, inherits size from a parent Menu, and has a dedicated storefront page covering standalone composition, first/middle/last action placement, parent-level search, and viewport-aware portal positioning.
- Migration: Remove authored trigger chevrons and avoid setting Button variant, alignment, weight, or size. Author a label-only direct Button followed by the nested Menu; set size on Submenu when standalone or on its parent Menu when composed.

### Improved

- Installable Muibook skills now use the standard `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` structure across the source repo and Muibook Knowledge package. Muibook Components replaces the retired Compose Web Components guide, while the MCP resolves the legacy compose id as an alias from `skill-index.json`. The former Skills storefront route now redirects to the consolidated Skills & Knowledge Base section on Plugins & MCP.
- Muibook agent knowledge now standardizes equal Grid tracks with `repeat(N, minmax(0, 1fr))`, requires complete spacing token references such as `var(--space-400)`, prefers container-based responsiveness for reusable compositions, distinguishes Card width from Card Body padding sizes, and treats unsupported Redactd Canvas components as useful registry gaps rather than failed work that must be deleted or rebuilt.
- Muibook chart knowledge now documents how to populate Redactd's structured Data and Series controls for Financial Chart, Market Sparkline, Financial Bar Chart, and Comparison Chart, including exact schemas, complete tree examples, and coherent illustrative-data generation.

### Added

- Carousel now owns a Card-like border by default and supports independent `borderless` and `radius="none"` options for flush embedded compositions.
- Carousel now supports touch, pen, and mouse swipe navigation by default, including horizontal intent detection, edge resistance, direct release-direction navigation, temporary selection suppression, interactive-control protection, and a `swipe="none"` opt-out.
- Illustration Trash now supports `motion="none | once | loop"` for internal particle choreography. One-shot motion uses a staggered reveal, while loop provides faster floating and fading particles; `play()`, `pause()`, and `restart()` controls and reduced-motion support are included.
- Added `variant="unstyled"` to Button and Link for wrapping structured, non-interactive content such as Card while removing action chrome, sizing, padding, typography, and link decoration without removing native semantics or focus treatment.
- Added `mui-menu` as the reusable visual surface for Dropdown menus and standalone overlay composition exploration. `mui-dropdown` continues to own portal positioning, focus, and dismissal behaviour.
- Added `mui-submenu` for composing a hover- and focus-revealed nested Menu from a direct Button trigger. It inherits the parent Menu action context, maintains a forgiving pointer bridge, closes cleanly after nested actions, and synchronizes `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded`.
- `mui-submenu` portals its nested Menu to a body-level overlay while open so focused controls, parent stacking contexts, and overflow containers cannot paint above or clip it. The authored Menu is restored when the Submenu closes or disconnects.
- `mui-submenu` provides viewport-aware collision handling: it prefers the inline end, flips to the inline start when constrained, shifts vertically, and overlaps the parent Menu as a final fallback instead of clipping outside the viewport. Position is recalculated during resize, ancestor scrolling, and nested Menu resizing.
- Added `mui-financial-chart`, powered by pinned `lightweight-charts@5.2.0`, for responsive candlestick and area market charts with a dedicated volume pane, local time-range controls, streaming updates, theme synchronization, and loading, empty, and error states. The component preserves the required TradingView attribution and provides a live accessible summary of the visible data.
- Financial Chart area mode now supports `trend="positive | negative | neutral"` with matching semantic line and fill tokens. Its compact comparison and dedicated treatment stories show every variant and the OHLCV data-property contract required to render them.
- Added `mui-market-sparkline` for compact line, area, and baseline financial trends with automatic positive or negative direction, streaming updates, optional interaction, theme-aware fills, loading, empty, and error states, and composable header and footer slots.
- Added `mui-financial-bar-chart` for time-based economic and financial histograms with neutral or baseline-aware directional bars, decimal, percent, currency, and volume formatting, configurable scales, streaming updates, optional interaction, and composable header and footer slots.
- Added `mui-comparison-chart` for absolute, indexed, and percentage-change comparisons across multiple financial time series, with local normalization, a six-color theme palette, per-series streaming updates, configurable scales and formatting, and composable header, legend, and footer slots.
- Updated the Dashboard composition with Market Sparkline KPI trends, a Comparison Chart for activation health, and a Financial Bar Chart for monthly recurring revenue, using deterministic example datasets and shared TradingView attribution.
- Added coordinated `x-small | small | medium | large` sizing to `mui-dropdown` and `mui-menu`; Dropdown enforces the size on its trigger and Menu, while Menu enforces it on direct button and link actions and owns their joined corner treatment.
- Added `offset` to `mui-dropdown` for CSS-length positioning values and `width` to `mui-menu` for explicit responsive surface sizing; the existing custom properties remain available as theme defaults.
- Added `x-small | small | medium | large` sizing to `mui-range-input`, retaining the previous thumb and track dimensions as medium. Date Picker, Time Picker, and Range Input stories now demonstrate every supported size.
- Direct `mui-body` content inside `mui-menu` now uses regular weight at one size below the Menu (`xx-small | x-small | small | medium`) while retaining padding matched to the parent Menu action size.
- Direct Input, Select, Textarea, Date Picker, Time Picker, Search Input, Range Input, and Chip Input controls inside `mui-menu` now inherit Menu size. Controls in the fixed `top` and `bottom` slots use the reusable `surface="seamless"` treatment and size-aware inline padding, while the new Menu `inset` option pads scrollable content and preserves each child control or action radius.
- Added `surface="seamless"` to Input, Select, Textarea, Search Input, Chip Input, Date Picker, and Time Picker for transparent composition against a parent Menu or Dropdown surface.
- `mui-menu` no longer applies first-action top corner radius when a direct `mui-body` heading precedes that action.
- Menu surfaces, Menu edge actions, and Input compositions now use size-aware form radius caps. Before/after Buttons, Links, Add Ons, and Chips preserve square joined corners while exposed corners receive the matching Menu inset radius.
- Direct Button and Link actions inside Menu now use `var(--font-weight-regular)` for a consistent action hierarchy.
- Added directional `--action-padding-block-*` and `--action-padding-inline-*` tokens for every action size. Existing `--action-padding-*` shorthand tokens now compose those values, allowing inset compositions to adjust inline padding without reconstructing the full shorthand.
- Added the resolved, size-aware `--menu-inset` custom property. Menu content, direct Body headings, Button and Link actions, and inset Rule spacing now share the same inset measurement.
- Added `--chip-background-menu` for direct Chip and Chip Input compositions inside Menu. Mui keeps the existing white treatment in light mode and uses `grey-900` in dark mode without changing the global Chip background; JAL, ANA, Sensei, and Paperclip provide matching brand mappings.
- Added the `content` CSS part to `mui-body`, exposing the internal span that wraps default body text for targeted composed-component styling.
- Pending Thinking states in `mui-work-log` now use a text-clipped linear-gradient shimmer with reduced-motion support. The theme-aware `--work-log-shimmer-color-primary` and `--work-log-shimmer-color-secondary` tokens are mapped for Mui, JAL, ANA, Sensei, and Paperclip themes.
- Added `--surface-elevated-50` and `--surface-recessed-50` as light- and dark-specific OKLCH interpolations between the matching grey primitives. Surface token stories now show the complete `50 | 100 | 200 | 300` elevated and recessed scales.
- Added `--header-min-height-x-small`, `--header-min-height-small`, `--header-min-height-medium`, and `--header-min-height-large`, with `--header-min-height` retaining the medium alias for app headers. Drawer and Dialog now map header height and built-in close action sizing through `close-size`; medium uses a small Button with the medium icon, while large uses a medium Button with the large icon.
- Added `none | small | medium | large` spacing sizes to `mui-card-body`. Market Sparkline stories use small bodies for compact market summaries and medium or large bodies for more spacious chart compositions.
- Added `level="none"` to `mui-heading` for prominent display text such as metrics and financial values that should retain Heading typography without entering the semantic document heading outline.
- Added `--white-opacity-5` to the primitive color scale, matching the existing `--black-opacity-5` token across base and branded token outputs. Base tertiary action hover and focus surfaces now use the matching 5% overlays in light and dark modes.
- `mui-tab-bar` now supports `usage="surface"` with dedicated `--tab-border-color-surface`, `--tab-background-surface`, and `--tab-background-active-surface` tokens. Card, Card Body, Dialog, Drawer, and Carousel apply the usage automatically through neutral layout wrappers while preserving the nearest nested surface owner. Non-inset Tab Bars use the subtle opacity stroke; surface Tabs with `active-inset` match the stroke to their background through `--tab-border-color-active-inset`.
- Tab Bars with `stroke="none"` now use visible overflow so focus and shadow treatments are not clipped. The story demonstrates this treatment against `--surface-recessed-50` and documents the surrounding-surface requirement.
- `mui-code` now supports `usage="surface"` and `--code-background-surface`, defaulting to `--surface-elevated-200`. Code detects Card, Card Body, Dialog, Drawer, and Carousel ancestors automatically, replacing the previous Card-only `card-slot` runtime treatment.
- Dialog and Drawer backgrounds now map through `--surface-elevated-100`, Carousel uses the same elevated semantic background, and Slide Frame content uses the base `--surface` so composed surfaces retain a consistent depth hierarchy across themes.
- Input and Textarea now support public `padding-block` and `padding-inline` overrides matching Select; Date Picker, Time Picker, Search Input, and Chip Input forward those values to their internal Input.
- Plain Input and Select controls now use matching inline padding at every size, including `space-100` at x-small and `space-200` at small.
- Renamed `mui-prompt-message` to `mui-chat-message` and moved its component export, story, documentation, and route to Chat Message.
- Renamed `mui-prompt-preview` to `mui-preview-chip`, including its `preview-chip-open` event and component-scoped CSS custom properties.
- Renamed `mui-prompt-toggle` to `mui-action-toggle` across the component export, stories, documentation, and Prompt compositions.

### Breaking Changes

- Prompt context placement now uses dedicated `context-above` and `context-below` slots. The previous `context` slot is removed; direct and wrapped Context Bars receive the correct attached edge treatment from their assigned slot.
- Removed the `condensed` boolean from `mui-card-body`. Use `size="none"` for edge-to-edge content; internal Slat composition markers and authored examples now use the size-based contract.
- Removed the `mui-prompt-message`, `mui-prompt-preview`, and `mui-prompt-toggle` component names and package exports. Use `mui-chat-message`, `mui-preview-chip`, and `mui-action-toggle` respectively.
- Renamed `mui-body` variants: `optional` to `secondary`, `success` to `positive`, and `error` to `attention`. The old variant values are no longer supported.
- Renamed semantic text tokens: `--text-color-optional` to `--text-color-secondary`, `--text-color-success` to `--text-color-positive`, and `--text-color-error` to `--text-color-attention`.
- Renamed `mui-form-message` variants to match Body semantics: `optional` to `secondary`, `success` to `positive`, and `error` to `attention`. The old values are no longer supported.
- `mui-dropdown` now requires a direct `mui-menu` child. Direct button/link options and the `dropdown-slot`, `dropdown-slot-first`, and `dropdown-slot-last` internal contracts have been removed; Menu now owns action normalization through `menu-slot*` markers.

### Fixed

- Context Bar now receives its attached border and corner treatment from Prompt's `context-above` or `context-below` slot, including when nested inside a composed Stack.
- Context Bar now uses symmetrical `space-100` inline padding so actions can sit closer to its edges. Context stories apply explicit `space-300` leading alignment to Body and grouped status summaries where required, while the Below Prompt composition remains flush.
- Dropdown now gives portaled Menu surfaces without an explicit width a stable `min(100%, 18rem)` default, preventing `max-content` and full-width actions from expanding the Menu to the temporary viewport-sized measurement wrapper. Explicit Menu `width` values still take precedence.
- Chips composed with Input and Chip Input now resolve exposed inner corner radii to exactly one pixel below the surrounding form radius at every size, while middle Chips remain square.
- Paperclip now maps the complete Financial Chart, Market Sparkline, Financial Bar Chart, and Comparison Chart token sets to its monochrome brand palette. Chart marks use blue in light mode and white in dark mode, including all Comparison Chart series.
- Comparison Chart now owns padding for its populated header region, allowing slotted header compositions to omit repeated spacing while preserving series keys and other supporting content.
- Financial Bar Chart now owns padding for populated header and footer regions. Its stories use edge-to-edge Card Bodies, consistent display typography, and complete code examples matching each rendered composition.
- Financial Chart, Financial Bar Chart, and Market Sparkline now share consistent neutral grey chart treatments in light and dark modes. Financial Bar Chart and Market Sparkline stories explicitly show neutral, positive, and negative colors for theme review.
- Comparison Chart automatic series colors now map to the matching Badge background tokens, keeping composed series keys and plotted lines synchronized across base and branded themes.
- Financial Chart, Financial Bar Chart, and Comparison Chart now draw a component-owned divider below their populated toolbar or header. Use `header-stroke="none"` for an uninterrupted header-to-plot treatment; Market Sparkline remains divider-free.
- Base secondary actions now use quieter border colours and 5% hover and focus overlays, while primary, secondary, tertiary, overlay, and attention action borders consistently use `--stroke-size-100`.
- Drawer resize rails now remain beneath Menu and overlay content, preventing the resize affordance from covering open actions without changing Menu's global stacking behavior.
- `mui-tab-bar` now synchronizes size, variant, position, active state, and highlight when Tab Items are added dynamically. Financial Chart range controls now retain `x-small` sizing, preserve focus during arrow-key navigation, and update the visible dataset without replacing the Tab Bar instance. The required TradingView attribution remains visible and clickable but no longer interrupts sequential keyboard navigation.
- Financial Chart now remains unframed for flexible composition, uses Card in its framed examples, and applies surface usage to its internal range Tabs when composed inside a recognized surface.
- Reduced the default active Tab shadow opacity in both light and dark themes while preserving branded theme control through the surface-specific Tab tokens.
- Drawer resize rails now use a compact `--stroke-size-500` interaction column with a clearer `--stroke-size-200` inner divider. Rail colors map through the shared border and elevated-surface semantics, improving consistency across Mui and branded themes without app-shell token leakage.
- Input, Select, and Textarea now keep their size-specific focus outlines as internal defaults, allowing instance-level `--input-focus-outline`, `--select-focus-outline`, and `--textarea-focus-outline` overrides to take effect without changing shared outline primitives.
- Menu now restores authored form-control `size`, `menu-slot`, `padding-inline`, and `surface` attributes when controls leave the Menu or the Menu disconnects.
- Textarea now combines row and padding custom properties in one style attribute so both configurations apply reliably.
- Input, Select, and Textarea now retain their size-resolved Menu radius when focused at x-small and small instead of forcing square corners.
- Menu stories now reserve `inset` for compositions with top or bottom regions, keep action-only menus edge-to-edge, and include dedicated all-size Time Picker and Chip Input examples.
- Inset Menu now passes internal inset state to direct Button and Link actions, which apply size-specific padding independently from Menu content padding.
- Inset Menu actions and form controls now retain their normal size-specific radius instead of inheriting a reduced Menu-derived content radius.
- Inset Button and Link actions now share one-to-one padding, radius, regular-weight, and leading-alignment behavior at every Menu size.
- Inset Menu content now adds size-aware bottom spacing only when a visible direct `mui-body` is present. Hidden live-region Bodies and Bodies assigned to fixed regions no longer affect content spacing.
- Direct `mui-rule` children inside inset Menu now use the resolved Menu inset for block margin, while default edge-to-edge Menu rules remain flush.
- Menu search stories now share independently scoped filtering behavior, explicitly hide unmatched custom-element actions, hide empty section headings, and reveal polite live-region Body messages when no results remain. Searchable, Inset Content, and Sections examples are wired across every demonstrated size.
- Grouped Content stories now demonstrate both edge-to-edge and inset compositions at `x-small`, `small`, `medium`, and `large` sizes.
- `mui-search-input` now reserves controlled `open` behaviour for populated `after` slot compositions, normalizes its Cancel action and direct Tab Bar to the input size, and removes meaningless Cancel state from standalone search fields.
- `mui-range-input` now uses a theme-aware solid thumb, custom filled track, correctly centered value bubble, and stable value updates that do not replace the native input during an active drag.
- Completed the prompt-component rename audit: restored the complete `--preview-chip-*` token family in the main light, dark, and shared theme layers, removed the remaining stale `--prompt-preview-*` declarations, and renamed the final Prompt Toggle story identifier to Action Toggle terminology.
- `mui-button` and `mui-link` now enforce their composed File Icon and Switch sizes. Activating a Button row also toggles its direct slotted Switch while preserving direct Switch interaction.
- File Icon now supports `x-small | small | medium | large` at 16px, 21px, 24px, and 28px. Button and Link pass only the mapped `size` attribute to composed File Icons, and a lone File Icon uses their icon-only layout.
- Date Picker and Time Picker now pass their resolved size to the internal Dropdown instead of forcing medium, preserving the correct Input and action radius at every Menu size.

- `mui-status` now supports `size="x-small"` with the same compact footprint as `mui-badge size="x-small"` for dense rows and Context Bar compositions.
- `mui-prompt-message` now applies default body rhythm between direct response children, with `--prompt-message-body-space` as the escape hatch for tighter or looser messages.
- `mui-prompt-message` footer actions now reveal on hover/focus by default and support `footer-visibility="always"` for app-pinned message action bars.
- `mui-worker` now adds balanced open-detail spacing with `padding-block-start` and `padding-block-end` set to `var(--space-200)`.
- `mui-worker` now supports `status`, `nested`, and `pending` states for non-interactive Thinking rows, compact child work rows, and Thinking-only shimmer labels.
- Top-level `mui-worker` rows in the `mui-prompt-message` header slot now draw the divider on the summary row, while nested and status rows remain unruled.
- `mui-prompt` now exposes a plain `slot="context"` above the prompt surface and no longer creates an internal context sheet; use `mui-context-bar` when a composed context row is needed.
- `mui-context-bar` now normalizes slotted `mui-body`, `mui-link`, `mui-button`, and `mui-status` content to `size="x-small"` and vertically centers summary slot content such as text paired with badges or statuses.
- `mui-code` inline snippets now use tighter prose padding, `var(--space-000) var(--space-100)`, when placed inside `mui-body` or `mui-list-item`.

### Fixed

- `mui-prompt` fan behavior now correctly keeps the fan trigger visible when the fan is closed, hiding it only if there are no slotted actions.
- `mui-prompt` now prevents nested fan actions (like `mui-prompt-toggle`) from redundantly replaying their stagger-bounce animation when clicked while the fan is already open.
- `mui-prompt` now supplies the action separator natively; manual `<mui-rule>` elements are no longer required inside the `actions` slot.

- Updated token stories to include semantic shadow tokens and media-player component tokens.
- Removed standalone `Type: Date` and `Type: Time` stories from the `mui-input` docs, relying on dedicated date/time pickers for explicit examples while preserving native `mui-input` functionality.

### Changed

- Updated optional text color token mappings so `--text-color-optional` meets WCAG AA contrast in supported light and dark themes.
- Updated the default Mui grey ramp, replacing `--grey-150` with `--grey-50` and adding `--grey-1300` / `--grey-1400` so surface depth tokens can map to distinct named stops without runtime color mixing.
- Updated default surface depth mappings so dark mode now separates `--surface`, elevated, and recessed surface stops.
- `mui-time-picker` and `mui-date-picker` now compose the standalone `mui-time` component instead of implementing inner time selection logic.
- Standardized inner day and time slot buttons in calendars and pickers to reuse the core `mui-button` styles with dynamic styling variants based on selection, maintaining focus styles across the UI.
- Removed custom radius CSS variables from `mui-time-picker` and `mui-date-picker` inner elements and standardized on `slotted` host styles to apply dropdown radius configurations.
- `mui-media-player` now uses dedicated local SVG icon components for play, pause, stop, restart, volume, Picture-in-Picture, fullscreen, and overflow controls.
- `mui-media-player` now keeps image/video overlay controls locked to the dark overlay treatment while compact audio and metadata surfaces remain theme-aware.
- `mui-media-player` artwork waveforms now use a stronger image-overlay treatment, while no-artwork waveforms use higher contrast theme-aware canvas colors.
- `mui-media-player` compact time controls now toggle between elapsed and remaining time instead of presenting an inactive action.
- `mui-media-player` control rendering was refactored into smaller helpers and now cleans up document-level fullscreen listeners on re-render/disconnect.
- `mui-media-player` now applies `usage="media-player"` automatically to slotted `mui-avatar-chip` content in metadata slots.
- `mui-media-player` waveform canvas interactions now bypass the parent frame's play/pause click handler to prevent accidental playback toggles.
- `mui-avatar-chip` avatar border and shadow now stay opt-in to `usage="media-player"` instead of appearing on the default avatar chip.
- `mui-drawer` resize rails now trigger a 3-cycle flashing animation (`rail-limit-flash`) when dragging reaches the minimum or maximum width boundaries.
- `mui-drawer` workspace panels now hide inner borders when resize rails are enabled.
- `mui-drawer` workspace and contained-height behaviour now share the `height` value across desktop, mobile overlay, panel, and page regions, with API docs covering workspace slots, resize rail sizing, and close-threshold controls.
- `mui-drawer` resize rails now support keyboard resizing with ArrowLeft/ArrowRight, larger Shift+arrow nudges, and focused workspace-side Escape closing.
- `mui-dropdown` now portals menu contents to avoid clipping in overflow-hidden media player surfaces.
- `mui-hint` now delegates focus to slotted buttons, links, and native controls instead of adding an extra wrapper tab stop, while keeping fallback keyboard focus for plain trigger content.
- `mui-hint` fallback trigger focus now uses the Muibook focus outline with an outset offset instead of the browser default outline.
- Resource navigation now moves Design Manifest out of Setup and into the new Knowledge section.
- `mui-chip` and `mui-chip-input` now dynamically inherit corner radii based on the host input size via `--chip-input-border-radius` to ensure perfectly parallel nested curves.
- `mui-input` slotted inline and hint icons now use slightly larger relative icon sizes for `medium` and `large` inputs.
- `mui-chip` now defaults to `size="medium"`.
- `mui-chip` layout now binds container height explicitly to token heights for all sizes (`x-small`, `small`, `medium`, `large`).
- `mui-chip` dismiss padding for `x-small` and `small` sizes now uses tighter token-based spacing to better align the close action.
- `mui-chip` slot styling for `before` and `after` icons now targets slots directly (`slot[name="before"]::slotted` and `slot[name="after"]::slotted`) utilizing token math (`calc(var(--space-050) * -1)`) for perfect inner margin alignment, fixing spacing regressions when both before and after icons/avatars are present.
- `mui-chip-rail` rail action controls now scale dynamically across sizes to perfectly match the height of the chips inside the rail.
- `mui-chip-rail` now adjusts its rail mask surface automatically when card content applies `card-slot`, while still supporting explicit `--chip-rail-background` overrides.
- Slotted sizing mapped: `mui-avatar` and `mui-badge` slotted inside `mui-chip[size="x-small"]` now resolve to `xx-small`.

### Fixed

- `mui-date-picker type="datetime"` now preserves preselected date/time values when the user changes the calendar or time selection instead of writing `value=""`.
- Story template descriptions now escape angle-bracket text so docs can reference element names such as model-viewer without rendering accidental HTML.
- `mui-drawer` in workspace variant now properly respects top and bottom safe-area insets (`env(safe-area-inset-top)` / `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`) in the page layout.
- `mui-drawer` mobile overlay panels now respect physical left and right safe-area insets in landscape, keeping drawer content clear of device cutouts while preserving the intended usable drawer width.
- Muibook storefront drawer styling now targets `mui-drawer::part(background)` instead of setting `--drawer-background` on the app shell host, preventing drawer surface styling from leaking into nested component stories.
- `mui-dropdown` now applies matching menu-item width, alignment, and first/last radius treatment to slotted `mui-link` items as well as slotted `mui-button` items.
- `mui-media-player` artwork thumbnail border and shadow now stay dark over artwork in both light and dark themes.
- `mui-media-player` volume icons now update reliably as the user adjusts the volume range.
- `mui-media-player` generated waveforms now repaint when theme or brand attributes change, avoiding stale canvas colors after light/dark theme switches.
- `mui-media-player` no longer applies the shared audio frame shadow to audio presentation wrappers, preventing metadata and artwork surfaces from leaking a shadow outside the intended frame.
- `mui-media-player` Picture-in-Picture and fullscreen controls now use Safari/WebKit video fallbacks, with Picture-in-Picture hidden when unsupported.
- Media Player video stories now provide a poster image so iOS Safari has a stable placeholder before playback.
- `mui-chip-rail` now removes the keyboard-only Skip chip from the tab order when the rail does not overflow.
- `mui-chip-rail` rail edge gradients now use a lower `z-index` to prevent overlay conflicts with floating elements like dropdown menus.
- `mui-carousel-controller` now keeps slotted tab controls above the carousel panels so tab hit targets and active-tab visuals remain usable over carousel content.
- `mui-dropdown` portaled menus now continue repositioning briefly after open and react to menu resize changes, preventing stale placement until window resize.
- `mui-dropdown` now cleanly closes itself when the viewport is resized instead of attempting to blindly adjust its open position.
- `mui-link` now applies higher specificity rules for dropdown slot border radii to prevent action size radii and icon slot styling from overriding them.
- Story template resource links now collapse into a single `mui-dropdown` on smaller viewports instead of wrapping as individual links.
- `mui-slat variant="row"` now matches condensed card body corner treatment, including single-row cases that need all exposed corners to follow the card radius.
- `mui-card-body` now marks first and last condensed slats with destination-only context attrs so wrapped slats can style exposed card edges correctly.

- `mui-button` and action-style `mui-link` now support `stroke="ring"` and `stroke-ring-size` for inset shadow strokes that avoid adding physical border height, defaulting to `stroke-ring-size="100"`.
- Added `mui-status` for compact object and workflow state labels with before/after slots.
- `mui-status` now supports the boolean `action` attribute for interactive status triggers with button semantics, keyboard activation, pointer cursor, and focus styling.
- Added `mui-chip-rail` for horizontal chip overflow with scroll controls, edge masking, size propagation, and configurable mask bleed.
- Added `mui-video-thumbnail` for reusable video poster thumbnails with themeable hover, play affordance, and opt-in border tokens.
- `mui-video-thumbnail` composed card examples now expose `--video-thumbnail-card-hover-background`, `--video-thumbnail-card-hover-edge-width`, and `--video-thumbnail-card-hover-edge-color-token` for themed faux hover surfaces and borders.
- `mui-prompt` now supports `preview-dialog-bordered` and `--prompt-preview-dialog-border` for turning on or customising the internal preview dialog border.
- `mui-tab-bar` now supports `stroke="border"` and `stroke="none"` so bordered and borderless tab bars can align to the action sizing rhythm.

- `mui-chip` label color now resolves through `--chip-text-color`, with hover, focus, and active clickable states exposing matching text color tokens.
- `mui-chip-rail` now uses 40px rail actions by default through `--chip-rail-action-size`, and focused slotted items scroll into view with a safe margin that accounts for the edge mask and rail actions.
- `mui-chip-rail` now includes a keyboard-only Skip chip that appears when tabbed to, allowing keyboard users to jump to the final rail action and tab out of long chip collections.
- MuiTube now uses `mui-video-thumbnail` for card poster images, with Paperclip opting into thumbnail borders from theme CSS.
- `mui-video-thumbnail` now keeps play and overlay affordances opt-in and supports slotted metadata for linked card compositions.
- `mui-button` and button-style `mui-link` now use explicit action size `min-height` tokens, with large actions aligned to the 5.6rem control rhythm.
- `mui-addon`, `mui-input`, `mui-select`, and `mui-switch` now reuse the shared `--action-size-*` sizing rhythm instead of older icon-only action size references.
- `mui-tab-item` now resolves its height through the parent tab bar, keeping bordered and borderless tab controls aligned to the same outer action height.
- `mui-body size="large"` now uses the 30px text rhythm and aligns leading inline icons against the larger line-height.
- `mui-hint` now reveals faster by default, using a 500ms delay with support for custom delays down to 250ms.
- `mui-step` now detects whether the `secondary` slot has content and only applies the vertical title-only offset when no secondary content is present.

### Fixed

- `mui-chip` and `mui-file-upload` now reset slotted `mui-button` min-height in compact internal action contexts.
- `mui-input` focused fields now keep their focus ring above hovered before/after slotted controls, while slotted controls still win hover stacking when the input is not focused.
- `mui-input` inside-before affordances now stay visible above the focused input surface, keeping leading search icons from being covered by the focused field.
- `mui-prompt` fan actions now stay anchored in place after the shared action sizing token updates.

## Header [End]

### Fixed

- `mui-h-stack`, `mui-v-stack`, and `mui-grid` now resolve `height`, `width`, `fill`, and `viewport` sizing onto the component host instead of relying on inherited custom properties, preventing nested layout components from inheriting parent viewport or fill sizing.

### Documentation

- `mui-drawer` now documents that push and persistent drawer page content should use a plain `div` as the direct `slot="page"` wrapper, with Stack or other layout components composed inside it.

---

## Header [Start]

## v19.5.0

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/19.5.0)

## Header [End]

### Added

- `mui-h-stack`, `mui-v-stack`, and `mui-grid` now support a `padding` attribute using CSS shorthand values, making inset layout spacing available without internal part overrides or inline styles.
- `mui-grid` now supports `height`, `width`, `fill`, and `viewport` sizing controls for parity with stack layouts and bounded alignment compositions.
- `mui-form-group` now supports `hide-heading` for groups whose visible heading is supplied by surrounding structure; the previous `hide-label` attribute remains accepted as a compatibility alias.

### Changed

- React typings now expose the new Stack and Grid layout controls.
- `mui-form-group` now renders its `heading` consistently as a semantic heading, including groups containing choice controls.

### Fixed

- `mui-h-stack` and `mui-v-stack` now keep default nested content intrinsic unless explicit sizing is requested, preventing unintended full-height stretching inside viewport and drawer layouts.

## Header [Start]

## v19.4.0

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/19.4.0)

## Header [End]

### Added

- `mui-h-stack` and `mui-v-stack` now support `height`, `width`, `fill`, and `viewport` sizing controls, allowing aligned content to fill explicit or viewport-height layouts without reaching into internal parts.
- `mui-field` now supports `variant="info"` messages with the matching informational icon and feedback color treatment.
- `mui-form-group` now supports `space`, `aligny`, `heading-space`, and `heading-level` for aligned mixed-control layouts and semantic section headings.
- Added public `--dialog-border` token for opt-in dialog surface borders while preserving the borderless default.
- Added public `--code-background` and `--prompt-preview-code-background` tokens for code and prompt preview code surface overrides.
- `mui-avatar` now supports `size="xx-small"` at 24px, while `size="x-small"` now provides a 32px option aligned to medium switch layouts.

### Changed

- `mui-code` now consumes `--code-background`, and prompt auto-preview code maps its background through `--prompt-preview-code-background`.
- `mui-drawer` header and footer now size intrinsically within its panel layout, keeping drawer content scrollable without fixed footer offsets when custom action content changes footer height.
- `mui-tab-bar` now consumes a complete `--tab-shadow-active` shadow value, backed by `--tab-shadow-active-color`, so active highlight geometry can be overridden without changing component CSS.
- Compact avatar compositions in `mui-chip`, `mui-button`, `mui-link`, and `mui-prompt-message` now use `xx-small` to retain their previous 24px footprint.
- `mui-switch` and `mui-prompt` derived styling variables no longer use private underscore-prefixed names, allowing intentional component-level overrides.

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/19.3.0)

## Header [End]

### Added

- `mui-button` now detects avatar-only composition when the default slot only contains `mui-avatar`, strips standard button chrome/spacing in that mode, and lets the avatar define the final control size.
- `mui-button` now exposes `avatar-only` in its dynamic attribute mapping so builder/runtime integrations can account for the structural state consistently.

## Header [Start]

## v19.2.0

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/19.2.0)

## Header [End]

### Added

- Added the new `mui-illustrations` component family with first export `mui-illustration-trash`.
- Added illustration component tokens for public main color, shadow, and size control.

### Changed

- `mui-illustration-trash` now supports theme-aware light/dark rendering and brand-aligned defaults.
- Derived illustration detail/atmosphere color mixing is now handled internally by the component instead of being exposed as public token API.

### Fixed

- `mui-dialog` now matches drawer-style header behavior: when no `slot="title"` content is provided, the header row and built-in close action are not rendered.

## Header [End]

### Changed

- Added public `--chip-input-background` token mapping in Muibook tokens for light and dark themes, and aligned `mui-chip-input` to consume that token for its shell background.
- `mui-prompt-toggle` story page now defines and surfaces its public prop types directly in the story-level props panel, keeping props UI mapping out of component docs/CEM.
- `mui-input` now supports `slot="inside-before"` and `slot="inside-after"` for internal leading/trailing affordances, with size-normalized slotted icon/badge treatment and matching story coverage.

### Fixed

- `mui-accordion-block` and `mui-accordion-inline` now respond cleanly to heading/size/detail content updates by re-rendering on observed attribute changes and re-syncing open height when slotted detail content changes; accordion detail slat groups also keep `usage="accordion"` applied.
- Removed the misleading fallback shell background from `mui-chip-input`; the component now relies on the mapped token value instead of an implicit hardcoded color.
- `mui-input` internal affordance spacing now measures actual slotted inside/hint content so padding stays consistent across sizes without relying on runtime attrs.
- `mui-input` now pushes size-aware slot height to slotted `mui-button` / `mui-link` controls, and input-composed buttons keep their flush `000` seam radius across size states.
- `mui-hint` now removes closed tooltip content from layout flow, preventing hidden hint text from creating horizontal overflow.

### Changed

- Added row action size tokens (`--row-action-xxs`, `--row-action-xs`, `--row-action-s`, `--row-action-m`, `--row-action-l`) and surfaced them in token docs.
- Table row sizing now maps `mui-row[size]` to row typography + action-cell sizing (`xx-small|x-small|small|medium|large`, default `medium`).
- `mui-chip-input` option list now uses `mui-button` options for visual parity with system action styles.
- Component token docs now group table action-size tokens under a dedicated Table section.
- Muibook routing now serves `mui-form-message` only; legacy `form-hint` story route/loader wiring was removed.

### Fixed

- `mui-card-body` now treats `condensed` as the final padding override, ensuring spacing remains zero even when helper attrs like `inner-space` / `has-card-slat-group` are present.
- `mui-slat[variant="action"][radius="none"]` now restores outer corners correctly for condensed card flows by applying first/last-of-type corner rules when `condensed-slot` is present.
- `mui-cell[action]` sizing now uses an internal wrapper with `box-sizing: border-box`, preserving outer cell padding while correctly honoring row-driven size tokens.

- `mui-chip-input` listbox interactions were moved to delegated handlers + targeted list updates for more stable input focus and option selection behavior.
- Removed stale, unserved `mui-form-hint` story file and Muibook `mui-form-hint` app import to avoid duplicate/legacy documentation paths.

## Header [Start]

## v18.2.0

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/18.2.0)

## Header [End]

### Changed

- `mui-tab-bar` click handling now resolves `mui-tab-item` via composed event path/closest matching, improving reliability across nested slotted content.
- `mui-body` small-size inline before/after icon fallback offset was tuned for better single-line and wrapped text alignment.
- `mui-hint` now auto-syncs trigger icon/badge size from nearest `mui-body[size]` (or `mui-hint[size]`) when trigger size is not explicitly set.
- Added `--stroke-size-050` (`0.5px`) to the core brand token set and token docs (including generated CSS/JS/iOS/Android outputs).
- Dynamic attributes are now sourced from per-component `dynamic-attrs.json` files and emitted as a generated manifest at `public/dynamic-attrs.json` (also published as `dist/esm/dynamic-attrs.json`).

### Fixed

- `mui-carousel-controller` now targets `mui-tab-bar` / `mui-tab-item` selectors consistently (instead of legacy `tab-bar` / `tab-item`), restoring tab-to-panel sync and initial active panel detection.

## v18.1.1

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/18.1.1)

## Header [End]

### Fixed

- Dropdown now applies `variant="tertiary"` only when slotted option buttons do not define a variant, preserving explicit variants like `primary`.
- Build output now includes the dropdown default-variant fallback logic for published dist.

---

## Header [Start]

## v18.1.0

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/18.1.0)

## Header [End]

### Changed

- Dropdown now applies `variant="tertiary"` to direct slotted option buttons only when no variant is provided, allowing explicit variants (for example `primary`) to override.
- Dropdown option slot styling now focuses on shape/radius behavior; option color behavior is left to button variants.
- Prompt hover surface now keeps overflow visible so slotted popovers/menus can expand beyond prompt bounds.

### Fixed

- Fixed dropdown option indexing so first/last radius attrs apply only to slotted `mui-button` items.
- Fixed prompt action layering so left/right action slots render above error region overlays.
- Fixed dropdown/table story consistency by standardizing ellipsis action icons and adding explicit size/active-option coverage.

## Header [Start]

## v16.0.0

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/16.0.0)

## Header [End]

### Breaking Changes

- Slide Frame public prop surface was reduced to user-facing controls only.
- Removed Slide Frame public props/paths that were internal or unused in product flows (`present`, `preview`, `lightbox`, `ratio-width`, `ratio-height`, and `ratio="custom"` option).

### Added

- Added `mui-slide-section` as a composable page wrapper for Slide Frame sections.
- Added cancelable Slide Frame `section-add-request` event so apps/builders can provide custom section insertion logic.

### Changed

_Status: Released_

[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@muibook/components/v/15.0.1)

## Header [End]

### Added

- Tabs: updated story coverage for before/after slot patterns, size variants, and default/full-width examples.
- Tabs: added `variant="ghost"` on `mui-tab-bar` to remove outer bar chrome while keeping active-tab emphasis.
- Tabs: `ghost` variant now removes highlight shadow for a clean chrome-free presentation.
- Badge: added size API (`x-small`, `small`, `medium`, `large`) with `medium` as default; sizing is now auto-enforced by host components in Button, Link, and Tab Item.
- Button/Link/Tab Item: added badge slot offset spacing for `before`/`after` usage and aligned small/x-small spacing tiers.
- Checkbox: updated label size mapping so `size="large"` uses medium body typography.
